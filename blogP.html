        Initially, photography appears straightforward, you buy a camera, point towards the subject and press the shutter. But as you dive deeper, you find the breadth of topics, perspectives, and ideas. When you're a beginner in this field, you are bound to get overwhelmed by learning the techniques like aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. In the words of Aristotle, â€œFor the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them." . In this journey towards learning this beautiful field of photography, let's have a look at a few tricks to help make your pictures stand out.

<h3>Landscapes</h3>
Always use smaller apertures when taking landscape images or photos with deep backgrounds. Apertures less than f/7 will produce pictures with focus on specific objects and not the whole scene, while apertures greater than f/13 may result in excessive chromatic aberration.

<h3>Portraits</h3>
Use Aperture Priority Mode: When you shoot in aperture priority, you can directly control the aperture, which in turn controls the depth of field. Using fast prime lenses, such as the 50mm f/1.4 and 85mm f/1.2, you can choose very large apertures for shallow depth of field. Your portraits will have a professional look if you use this method to create creamy-smooth, out-of-focus backgrounds. When you work with a narrow band of sharpness, you have to be careful when focusing. If the eyes are not properly focused, the whole portrait will look soft.

<h3>Tiles and Tablets for Reflection</h3>
Place your object on a smooth tile or your tablet's screen and then click from an angle which provides the best view of the reflection. Product photography can be enhanced by this technique. However, it also gives amazing results in architectural and portrait photography.

<h3>Focus on the "Eye"</h3>
A portrait should always have sharp eyes, even if eye contact isn't desired. Focus on your subjects eyes by manually selecting an auto focus (AF) point over their eye, or connect the focus point on their eye by using the central focus point. Recompose your picture before taking it, keeping the shutter release half-pressed to keep the setting locked.

<h3>Vaseline Effect</h3>
Use vaseline on your lens filters or one piece of clear transparent glass to create hazy and smudged effects. Apply it in different patterns (circular or criss-cross).

Hope these techniques enhance your photography skills. Happy Clicking!
