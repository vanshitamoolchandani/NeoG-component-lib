        <p>Design Thinking approach is to define an idea by its structural parts and focusing on how an idea helps a person achieve a task. It’s an iterative problem-solving approach that aims to improve people’s experiences by understanding the user, challenging assumptions, and redefining problems. Design Thinking goes beyond just the visual aesthetics and can be applied to products, services, experiences, processes, organizational design, and strategy. A Design Thinker’s characteristics entail Empathy, Integrative thinking, Optimism, Experimentation and Collaboration. In contrast to Design Thinking, Human Centered Design is a design and management mindset that focuses on people who will use the product or service and the ethos of developing a solution specifically tailored to their needs.</p> 
Reframing problems by looking at situations from different individuals’ points of view results in product designs and experiences that match their specific needs.
 Empathy sits in the heart of this approach and consistently proves itself as a route to solving tough problems rooted in human needs resulting in deeply impactful and long-lasting solutions. SCAMPER technique encourages you to take a step back and visualize a problem from multiple viewpoints (S) substitute, (C) combine, (A) adapt, (M) modify, (P) put to another use, (E) eliminate and (R) reverse. This small change in approach to problem solving provides a structure to brainstorming and helps explore the problem from varied perspectives instead of just being driven by the need to provide rapid solutions.
